         Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis
         (ME), is a complex and debilitating condition characterized by extreme
         fatigue that does not improve with rest or sleep. The exact cause of
         CFS is not fully understood, but researchers believe it may be related
         to abnormalities in the immune system, the nervous system, or both. In
         addition to fatigue, common symptoms of CFS include muscle and joint
         pain, headaches, cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, and
         sensitivity to light and noise. The severity and duration of symptoms
         can vary widely from person to person, and they can significantly
         impact daily life, often leaving individuals unable to work, attend
         school, or engage in other activities.

         Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) can have a significant impact on the
         body. The primary symptom of CFS is extreme fatigue that is not
         relieved by rest, which can be accompanied by muscle and joint pain,
         headaches, and other physical symptoms. This fatigue can also have a
         range of effects on the body, such as reduced exercise tolerance,
         decreased immune function, and impaired cognitive abilities, including
         difficulties with memory and concentration. Additionally, many
         individuals with CFS experience sleep disturbances, such as insomnia or
         interrupted sleep, which can exacerbate other symptoms and further
         impact overall health and wellbeing. The exact mechanisms by which CFS
         affects the body are not fully understood, but research suggests that
         it may be related to abnormalities in the immune and nervous systems.
         Managing the symptoms of CFS is crucial to improving overall health and
         quality of life for individuals with this condition.

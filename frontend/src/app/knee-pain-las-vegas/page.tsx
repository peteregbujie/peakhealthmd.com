        What is Knee Pain?
       </h2>

       <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
        <p>
         Knee pain is a common complaint that can occur due to various reasons,
         including injury, overuse, underlying medical conditions, or the
         natural aging process. The knee is a complex joint composed of bones,
         ligaments, tendons, muscles, and cartilage, and any disruption or
         damage to these structures can lead to knee pain.

        What Causes Knee Pain?
       </h2>

       <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
        <p>
         Injuries: Knee pain often results from injuries, such as sprains,
         strains, tears, or fractures. These injuries can occur due to sudden
         movements, overextension, or direct trauma to the knee. For example,
         tearing of the ACL or meniscus commonly leads to knee pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Overuse: Repeated stress on the knee joint, often caused by activities
         like running, jumping, or repetitive movements, can lead to overuse
         injuries. Conditions like patellofemoral pain syndrome or iliotibial
         band syndrome can develop, causing pain around the kneecap or the outer
         side of the knee, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative joint disease that commonly
         affects the knee joint. Over time, the cartilage that cushions the
         bones in the knee can wear away, leading to bone-on-bone contact and
         resulting in pain, stiffness, and swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rheumatoid Arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition
         that can cause inflammation and damage to the knee joint, leading to
         pain, stiffness, and swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tendonitis: Inflammation of the tendons around the knee, such as
         patellar tendonitis (also known as jumper's knee) or quadriceps
         tendonitis, can cause knee pain.
        </p>

        What are the Symptoms of Knee Damage?
       </h2>

       <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
        <p>
         Pain: Knee pain can range from a dull ache to sharp, stabbing pain. The
         intensity and location of the pain may vary depending on the specific
         condition or injury. Swelling: Inflammation of the knee joint can lead
         to visible swelling, often accompanied by warmth and tenderness around
         the joint.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stiffness: Knee pain may cause stiffness and reduced range of motion,
         making it difficult to fully bend or straighten the knee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weakness or instability: Some individuals with knee pain may experience
         weakness or a feeling of instability in the knee, making it challenging
         to bear weight or perform certain activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clicking or popping: In some cases, knee pain may be accompanied by
         clicking, popping, or grinding sounds during movement. These sounds can
         indicate the presence of a meniscal tear or other structural issues
         within the knee joint.

        Shockwave Therapy for Knee Pain Treatment
       </h2>

       <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
        <p>
         Unlike traditional treatments, such as medication or surgery, shockwave
         therapy stimulates the body's natural healing mechanisms to address the
         underlying issues causing your knee pain. Through the use of focused,
         high-energy sound waves, this advanced therapy accelerates tissue
         repair, reduces inflammation, and promotes regeneration in the affected
         area.

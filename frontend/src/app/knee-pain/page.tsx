      What is Knee Pain?
     </h2>

     <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
      <p>
       Knee pain is a common complaint that can occur due to various reasons,
       including injury, overuse, underlying medical conditions, or the natural
       aging process. The knee is a complex joint composed of bones, ligaments,
       tendons, muscles, and cartilage, and any disruption or damage to these
       structures can lead to knee pain.

      What Causes Knee Pain?
     </h2>

     <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
      <p>
       Injuries: Knee pain often results from injuries, such as sprains,
       strains, tears, or fractures. These injuries can occur due to sudden
       movements, overextension, or direct trauma to the knee. For example,
       tearing of the ACL or meniscus commonly leads to knee pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overuse: Repeated stress on the knee joint, often caused by activities
       like running, jumping, or repetitive movements, can lead to overuse
       injuries. Conditions like patellofemoral pain syndrome or iliotibial band
       syndrome can develop, causing pain around the kneecap or the outer side
       of the knee, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative joint disease that commonly
       affects the knee joint. Over time, the cartilage that cushions the bones
       in the knee can wear away, leading to bone-on-bone contact and resulting
       in pain, stiffness, and swelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rheumatoid Arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition
       that can cause inflammation and damage to the knee joint, leading to
       pain, stiffness, and swelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tendonitis: Inflammation of the tendons around the knee, such as patellar
       tendonitis (also known as jumper's knee) or quadriceps tendonitis, can
       cause knee pain.

      What are the Symptoms of Knee Damage?
     </h2>

     <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
      <p>
       Pain: Knee pain can range from a dull ache to sharp, stabbing pain. The
       intensity and location of the pain may vary depending on the specific
       condition or injury. Swelling: Inflammation of the knee joint can lead to
       visible swelling, often accompanied by warmth and tenderness around the
       joint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stiffness: Knee pain may cause stiffness and reduced range of motion,
       making it difficult to fully bend or straighten the knee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weakness or instability: Some individuals with knee pain may experience
       weakness or a feeling of instability in the knee, making it challenging
       to bear weight or perform certain activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clicking or popping: In some cases, knee pain may be accompanied by
       clicking, popping, or grinding sounds during movement. These sounds can
       indicate the presence of a meniscal tear or other structural issues
       within the knee joint.

      ShockWave Therapy for Knee Pain Treatment
     </h2>

     <article className="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-600 ">
      <p>
       Unlike traditional treatments, such as medication or surgery, shockwave
       therapy stimulates the body's natural healing mechanisms to address the
       underlying issues causing your knee pain. Through the use of focused,
       high-energy sound waves, this advanced therapy accelerates tissue repair,
       reduces inflammation, and promotes regeneration in the affected area.

         Cognitive behavioral therapy, light therapy, and continuous positive
         airway pressure (CPAP) therapy are three types of sleep therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to change negative thought patterns
         and behaviors that contribute to poor sleep. Light therapy involves
         exposure to specific types of light to regulate the body's circadian
         rhythm. CPAP therapy uses a machine to provide a constant flow of air
         to keep the airways open during sleep.
